The answer is unfortunately no. AirServer 5 does not support Windows XP or Windows RT[^3^]. This is because AirServer 5 uses Windows port completion for high performance networking, which is only available on machines running Windows Vista or newer[^3^]. Therefore, if you want to use AirServer 5 on your PC, you will need to upgrade your operating system to at least Windows 7.
 
If you are looking for an alternative solution to mirror your device's screen to your Windows XP PC, you might want to try some other software that does not require Windows port completion. However, keep in mind that these software might not offer the same features and quality as AirServer 5. Some examples of such software are:
 
- [LonelyScreen](https://www.lonelyscreen.com/): A simple and free AirPlay receiver for Windows and Mac.
- [Mirroring360](https://www.mirroring360.com/): A screen mirroring and sharing software for Windows and Mac that supports AirPlay, Google Cast and Miracast.
- [ApowerMirror](https://www.apowersoft.com/phone-mirror): A screen mirroring and control software for Windows and Mac that supports iOS and Android devices.

However, before you download and install any of these software, make sure to check their compatibility and security requirements. Also, be aware that some of them might require a paid subscription or a one-time purchase to unlock all their features.
 
In conclusion, AirServer 5 is a great software for screen mirroring and streaming, but it does not work on Windows XP. If you want to use it on your PC, you will need to upgrade your operating system. Alternatively, you can try some other software that might work on Windows XP, but they might not offer the same quality and functionality as AirServer 5.
  
If you are wondering why you should use AirServer 5 instead of other software, here are some of the benefits that AirServer 5 offers:

- **Retina quality mirroring**: AirServer 5 provides drastically improved picture quality during mirroring. Starting with iPhone 6 Plus, iOS devices can now mirror at full 1080 x 1920 resolution, which is over 3x the previous pixel count.
- **Encrypted AirPlay**: AirServer 5 protects your personal photos and videos as they are transmitted over the network. This important security feature is only offered by AirServer 5 and the Apple TV.
- **iOS 12 Compatible**: AirServer 5 has maintained AirPlay compatibility since iOS 4.2.1 and has pushed out free compatibility updates with every major version of iOS since 2011.
- **Live streaming to YouTube**: YouTube Live certified, AirServer 5 will enable you live stream your iOS gameplay with unique picture-in-picture webcam support. Teachers can also use this powerful technology to live stream their lectures.
- **Bring Your Own Device**: AirServer 5 introduced the worldâs first BYOD solution by implementing all the major mirroring technologies giving everyone the freedom of choice for the device they wish to use. Zero Client Footprint Since AirServer 5 communicates using AirPlay, Google Cast and Miracast, there is no need to install any 3 rd party apps on the client's device. Everything needed is already builtâin and it is super easy to get started.

As you can see, AirServer 5 is a powerful and versatile software that can enhance your screen mirroring and streaming experience. However, if you have a Windows XP PC, you will not be able to use it. Therefore, we recommend that you upgrade your operating system or try some other software that might work on Windows XP.
